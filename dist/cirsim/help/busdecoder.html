<p>The Decoder component converts a 2 to 4-bit binary value
	to a true on one of four to sixteen output lines. The number of outputs is determined
	by the bit size and is configurable. The component can be configured for bus or single-bit inputs.</p>

<p>In this figure, a value of 4 (0b100) is decoded to a high on output O4, lighting the corresponding
	LED in an <a href="ledbar.html">LED Bar.</a> The Bus Decoder will also draw a line from the input
to the corresponding activated output. If any input is undefined, the outputs are
also undefined (?) and the line does not appear.</p>
<p>When configured as a bus input, if the number of bits on the input exceeds the input size,
additional bits are ignored. In the above example if the input pin is set as 0b1100, the output
will still be decoded to a high on output O4. The additional high-order output bit is ignored.</p>
