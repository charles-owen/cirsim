<p>The Out Pin component is a circuit output pin, an indicator of a value of true or false for a connection.
  The current state is indicated by the value 0 or 1 and an LED. An illuminated LED indicates a value of one. </p>

<p>The names of outputs are significant to testing and are used as the outputs for
reference components. Names must be unique in a given tab.</p>
<p>The special color value of 'none' disables the LED and the value indication on the output pin. This
mode is useful when the output value of a circuit is meant to be hidden.</p>
