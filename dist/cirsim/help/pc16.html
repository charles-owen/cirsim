<p>Simple 16-bit program counter (PC). Each clock rising
edge increments the PC by 2 (16 bits). If B is true, the signed value
in BA (branch address) plus 2 is then added to the PC. All updates occur
on the clock leading edge.</p>
<p>The R input is a reset. When high, the program counter is reset to
0x0000.</p>
