<p>The In Pin component is a circuit input pin, a source for a value of true or false. Anything it is connected to
  will receive a constant one value. The current state is indicated by the value 0 or 1 and an LED. Green
  indicates a value of one. The value can be changed from one to zero or zero to
one (toggled) by clicking on the LED. </p>
