<h2>Multiplexer</h2><p>Multiplexes 2 to 16 inputs to a single output. The
	inputs and outputs and can be configured as buses or single bits. The multiplexer symbol includes
an indication of which input is currently selected.</p>
<p>The value of the input pin or bus determines which input is routed to O. The input will be a single
	bit if there are two choices (binary) or a bus if there are more than 2 choices. </p>

<p>The top example has been configured as a two input bus multiplexer. Since there are only two
possible inputs, the selector input is a single bit. A value of true selects input I1.</p>
<p>The second example has been configured as an eight input bit multiplexer. The bus input is set
to a value of 101 (5) so input I5 is selected to the output.</p>
