<p>The Cirsim <em>text</em> component allows for arbitrary notations for diagrams. Allows for placed notations that help
  describe parts of diagrams. The text size in pixels can be specified, as can the colors from a
  limited palette.</p>

<p>The color selection is overridden by the selection color (red) when the
  text component is selected.</p>
<p>The clickable point for text is a box at the center of the text. This can make it a bit harder
to select larger text components. Just try clicking close to the middle of the text string.</p>
