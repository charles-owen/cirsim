<p>The Counter component is a simple counter. Supports up and down counting for
  arbitrary bit sizes. C is the count output. The optional UP input controls the counting
  direction. True means up counting. If not connected, the counter counts up. The counter increments or decrements on the clock leading edge.</p>
<p>The R input is a reset. When high, the counter is reset to
zero.</p>
