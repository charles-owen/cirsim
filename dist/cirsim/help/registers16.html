<p>The Registers component is a simple 16-bit register file. Ae and Be choose which register is routed to
	the A and B outputs. ALU is the input from the ALU. ALUe chooses which register to write.
	A register will only be written if W (write enable) is high.</p><p>R is a reset input and is optional.
	The R input (reset) sets all registers to zero.</p>
<p>The register file latches in the ALU result on the clock <em>leading edge</em> and sets the
	register on the clock trailing edge.</p>

<p>During operation, the contents of the registers are displayed and the current configurations of
Ae, Be, ALUe, and W are indicated by lines the connect ALU to a register and registers to A and B.</p>
