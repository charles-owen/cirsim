<p>The Extend component extends a
	bus to a larger size. A common use is to extend an immediate value
	from an instruction to 16 or 32 bits.</p>
<p>The output can be optionally logically shifted left by a fixed number of bits.</p>

<p>The extension can be logical or arithmetic. Logical extensions extend with zeros. An arithmetic extend
will mirror the high order bit.</p>
